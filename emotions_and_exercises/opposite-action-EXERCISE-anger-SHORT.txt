NOTES FROM THE VIDEO - UNNECESSARY FOR THE APP
Step 1: Figure out which emotion you are experiencing, because you can't do opposite action if you don't know how you are feeling. 

Step 2: What are the facts of the sitaution. What are you reacting to. Does the situation fit the emotion that you are feeling. If you are sad, did you actually lose something? If you are angry, was some goal of yours blocked? Does your emotion fit the facts. 

Step 3: What is the action that you want to do. What's my urge to act on this emotion? 

Step 4: Ask yourself, do you want to change your emotion, because opposite action will help you do this. 

Step 5: If you want to feel differently, then carry out the opposite action. 

You have to do it all the way - with your body and your actions. It takes practice!

Exercise within app below: 

Great, let's work through an example. 
THinking back to a time in which you experienced an emotion that did not fit the facts, what was the emotion you wanted to change? 

Anger: 

Check the facts: are you assuming a threat about the emotion? Does your emotion or its intensity fit the facts?

What was your action urge?

Is acting on that action urge effective to your goals of the situation? 
YES/NO

Okay, so opposite action can help: step into the other person's shoes, change your posture, slowly bring the corners of your mouth up to a half-smile; relax your hands and hold your palms face up on your lap; pace your breathing slowly and deliberately.
